## Description
This is an ASP.NET Core MVC web application. 
This web application will allow a user to put in a span of 2 different years, 
and a list of all the winners from the TIME Person of the Year will be displayed.



## Application Specifications

###### Your application should include the following:
- Start with an empty Web App template, with all controllers and views manually created, do not scaffold. If you are having trouble remembering the process to create a basic MVC app, refer to the Additional Resources section below for assistance.  
- Add the MVC Middleware and include template routing (the route must be explicitly defined)
- Only 1 controller. The home controller, with 3 actions (2 Index, and 1 Results)

- Upon posting back to the server, call the Results action to redirect to the results view.
Views to generate the home page and search results
- Use a form tag to accept user input
- Use Tag Helpers to help redirect you from results page to the Home page. (_ViewImports.cshml file may be required)
- Include HTML/CSS in your final product. This is required.
